A web application which displays posts and allows the user to upload their own (as well as delete). Created with the ever reliable combination of blood, sweat, and tears.

people-Strapi/public/js contains the bulk of the JavaScript code I wrote. The HTML and CSS can be found in people-Strapi/public/index.html and people-Strapi/public/css/style.css respectively.

There are no commits as this application was originally written for a university unit which did not utilise GitHub.
